# AMeteostatoin
It is software for my astronomical meteostation (that's why "A" in the name)
Software contains: 
 Module for Arduino Uno, that intended for sensor's data collection
 Module for Rasberri PI, that collect data from Arduino and proccess it
 Module for Raspberri PI, that control Canon's EOS camera and process photos
